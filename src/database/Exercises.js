Get into a high plank position, hands shoulder - width apart, core engaged.Lower your chest towards the ground, elbows tucked in tight.Feeling the burn ? Push back up explosively, keeping your body in a straight line.Aim for 3 sets of as many reps as you can with good form. Next, the dumbbell bench press: Time to add some weight! Grab dumbbells that challenge you, lie back on a bench, and press them upwards until your arms are straight(but not locked).Feel the squeeze in your chest as you lower the dumbbells back down.Control the descent – no dropping those weights! Do 3 sets of 8 - 12 reps for maximum muscle growth. Remember, proper form is key.If you feel any pain, stop and adjust the exercise.Take short rests between sets and feel the pump in your chest!",
